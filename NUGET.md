# Clean GraphQL API

This is a template API using [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) alongside a .net implementation of [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet).

## Installation
This is a template and you can install it using the [dotnet new cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new).  To install the lastest version of the template run the following command.
```
dotnet new --install CleanGraphQLApi.Template
```
To create a new solution using this template run the following command
```
dotnet new cleangraphqlapi --name {YOUR_SOLUTION_NAMESPACE} --au "{YOU_AUTHORS_NAME}"
```
